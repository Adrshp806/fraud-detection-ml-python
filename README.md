# Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions using Machine Learning

This project explores how machine learning can detect fraudulent transactions in financial datasets. It was developed as part of a master's degree project using a labeled dataset from Kaggle. The work includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, handling class imbalance, and evaluating multiple classification models.

## üìà Results Summary

| Model              | Accuracy | F1 Score | Notes                              |
|--------------------|----------|----------|------------------------------------|
| Random Forest      | 100%     | 1.00     | High performance, overfitting risk |
| Decision Tree      | 100%     | 1.00     | Same as above                      |
| XGBoost            | 100%     | 1.00     | Strong, but suspiciously perfect   |
| Logistic Regression| 95%      | 0.87     | Best generalization so far         |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The perfect accuracy in some models may indicate overfitting due to class imbalance or data leakage.
